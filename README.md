# FastAPI Fashion Trend Predictor

This project is a FastAPI-based web application for predicting fashion trend categories using a combination of images and captions. It leverages machine learning models to analyze and predict trends in fashion.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the FastAPI application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-fashion-trend-predictor.git
cd fastapi-fashion-trend-predictor
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Run the FastAPI app:

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

2. Access the app in your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

3. Use the API endpoint to predict fashion trends. Upload an image and provide a caption to receive the predicted trend category.

### Docker (Alternative)

You can also run the app using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t fastapi-app .
```

2. Run a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
```

## Customization

- Replace the models, data sources, and prediction logic in `app/models.py` to suit your needs.
- Customize the API endpoints and additional features in `app/api.py`.
